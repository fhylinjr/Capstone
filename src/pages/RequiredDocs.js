                                                        from the school
                                                        administration and forwarding it to them so they can verify it and submit it

                                                        high school is 4 years.
                                                        Hence some colleges might ask for the last year of your JHS results. In that

                                                        recommendation. It is a
                                                        good strategy to select teachers who know you well and can speak highly of
                                                        you. Also you can consider
                                                        teachers who teach subjects related to what you intend on studying in
                                                        college. E.g if you want to study
                                                        Math, then probably you might want to consider one of your Math teachers as
                                                        a recommender.
                                                        <br /> Your teachers or counselors might be working with other students so it
                                                        is advisable to start this process
                                                        as soon as you can by politely discussing with them you plan on using them
                                                        as recommenders to get their contact details
                                                        such as emails and phone numbers so they can submit their recommendation and
                                                        evaluation on their end.
