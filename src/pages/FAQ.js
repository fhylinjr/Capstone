                                            For now most schools are test-optional meaning you can choose not to write it. However,
                                            it is strongly recommended to at least to write it and only choose not to submit it if
                                            you do not perform well because SAT is a very strong data point that can be helpful.
                                            However if it is impossible for you to write it, that is okay as well. Just keep working
                                            on all other aspects of your application and make sure they are strong as well.

                                            We would not necessarily compare both because A-Levels is usually a national leaving
                                            exam while the SAT is just an aptitude exam set by College Board to those willing to
                                            study in most US colleges. Regardless, A-Levels is a highly recognized exam compared to
                                            other national leaving exams but not every high school offers that so that is why it is
                                            important to look at the options you have. It is always advisable to write the SAT/ACT
                                            if you can.

                                            As the name suggests, need-based aid is simply based on your family's financial
                                            inability to pay for your total educational expenses and that is usually determined
                                            based on financial information (income, taxes, assets) you provide for the college to
                                            calculate that need. The more money your family earns, the less your need based aid
                                            might be. Merit based aid is usually based on some accomplishments. Maybe you had a very
                                            high SAT score or valedictorian or you wrote a scholarship essay or you were very
                                            involved with your community. Basically, you could get merit-based aid whether your
                                            family is a high-income or low-income one. Your financial aid package might be either
                                            one or a combination of both.

                                            school gave you and because you need to have your needs met fully to attend you can use

                                            For some schools interviews are randomized so you may or may not get invited which is
                                            totally fine. However if you do get selected for an interview, it is strongly
                                            recommended you accept and attend it. Some also provide options earlier on to apply for
                                            an interview and I would say that is optional. Most students get in without an
                                            interview. It really can help when you know a lot about the school and the program you
                                            are vying for.

                                            yet. You can appeal for an upward review of the financial aid and it has worked for
                                            multiple students before. You just have to send an email to the Financial Aid Office
                                            explaining your situation and usually they might review it. They might also be able to
                                            provide you with on-campus employment/ loan options you could explore. You never know

                                            So for instance based on your css profile the school can estimate that you can only pay
                                            $1000 per year for college. But different schools have different total cost of
                                            attendance so let us say school A total cost to attend is 70k and school B is 60k.
                                            <br />
                                            Both schools know you can only afford to pay 1k. School A can then give you a
                                            scholarship of $69k.
                                            <br />
                                            School B knows it has to give you 59k for you to be able to attend but now it looks at
                                            your SAT scores and transcripts and notices that you are not really a good student they
                                            might not give it to you and reject you.
                                            <br />
                                            Sometimes it sees you are a great student but maybe the school does not have as much
                                            money as Harvard so cannot afford to give you the 59k so they will reject/waitlist you.
                                            <br />
                                            So there are so many circumsantances. Ultimately the more funds the school has and the
                                            more exceptional your application is as a student the higher your chances of getting all
                                            your needs met.
